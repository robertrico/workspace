set
"A set is a collection of "things" called "elements" or "members"."
sequence
"A set, where order is relevant and important."
universal set
"The symbol U is used to denote the 'Universal Set', which is all elements under consideration."
set-builder notation
"Denoted as {x | (requirements of set)}, good for infinite sets."
finite set
"A set with a determined amount of elements."
infinite set
"A set with an infinite amount of elements."
empty set
"Also called a void, or null set. A set that contains no elements."
cardinality
"The number of elements contained within a set. Denoted by "| |"."
subset
"Every element of X is an element of Y. That is, a subset is defined as a set whose elements are contained within a parent set."
proper subset
"Like a subset, but the two sets cannot be equal. If Y is a subset of X, and does not equal X, it is proper subset."
power set
"The set of all subsets, proper or not of a set."
union
"Denoted with U, such as X U Y. All the elements belonging to either X or Y. Elements of one, but not the other."
intersection
, it is all elements belonging to both Y and X."
disjoint
"X and Y are disjoint, if the Intersection of X and Y is Null/Empty/Void."
pairwise disjoint
"A collection of sets is said to be pairwise disjoint if whenever X and Y are distinct sets in S, X and Y are disjoint."
difference
"Or relative complement, All elements of X that are not in Y"
complement
"Given a Universal set U and Subset X, the set U - X is called the Complement of X."
partition
"A collection of nonempty subsets of X for which every element in X belongs to exactly one member of S. A={1,2,3,4} Partitions of A are: B={1,3} and C={2,4}"
cartesian product
"X x Y, Set of all ordered pairs (x,y) where x is an element of X and y is an element of Y."
corinne
The love of my butt.
logic
"Logic is the basis of all mathematical reasoning."
argument
"Consists of assumptions and conclusions
assumptions
"hypothesis premises, or givin propositions"
conclusions
"Propositions that follows from assumptions"
logical operators
" AND, OR, and NOT"
proposition
"A declarative sentence that is either true, or false, but not both"
formal logic
"Concerning form rather than content
negation
"NOT"
conjuction
"AND"
disjunction
"OR"
converse
"(Given the hypothesis p, and the conclusion q) 'If p, then q'"
contrapositive
"(Given the hypothesis p, and the conclusion q) 'If not q, then not p'"
inverse
"(Given the hypothesis p, and the conclusion q) 'If not p, then not q'"
domain of discourse
"Let D be a set, and P(x) be a proposition invloving x. If for each x âˆˆ D, P(x) is a proposition, we Call D the domain of discourse of P"
propositional function
"A function of propositions. Essentially a propsition containing an element that can be changed, denoted like P(x), with x being a variable. Search 'propositional function example'"
propositional function example
"Let P be the proposition 'THIS OPERATING SYSTEM is the best.' THIS OPERATING SYSTEM is the variable here. P(Linux) = 'Linux is the best' also, P(Windows) = 'Windows is the best', and lastly P(OsX) = 'OsX is the best'"
